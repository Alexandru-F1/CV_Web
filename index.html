        <h2>Hello!</h2>
        <p class="my-description">
          I am a developer with 3+ years of experience in Unity and C#. I am an
          ambitious, creative and organized person with a good team spirit. My
          passion for video games made me curious to find out as much as
          possible about how they are created. Due to this I developed my
          passion for programming and I started to develop mobile and desktop
          applications.

          <h3>Lost Dog Game</h3>
          <p class="dog-game-description">
            I created a 2D platformer game in Unity (using C#) where you can
            control a dog, your goal is to overcome as many obstacles and pass
            each level. The game contains different enemies and different
            obstacles, each obstacle and enemy behaves differently. The graphics
            of the whole game were made by me in Asesprite, including the
            animations. The game can be played on Android and IOS, having on
            Google Play 50.000+ installs.

          <h3>Home Design AR Application</h3>
          <p>
            With this mobile application a user can create different rooms. He
            can customize the walls by changing their type, color or texture. He
            can add different pieces of furniture and rotate or move them. With
            the help of AR Camera, the user can access the Augmented Reality
            (AR) module and can view the camera in real proportions. Thanks to
            this application a person can create his own camera only using his
            mobile phone if he wants to recondition, so this process will be
            much easier. In the development of this application I used: Unity,
            C#, XR Foundation and different systems/scripts created by me
